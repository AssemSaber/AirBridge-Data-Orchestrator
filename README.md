# <div>**Project Overview**</div>
- **The Flight Data Platform is a full end-to-end data engineering project that ingests, processes, analyzes, and visualizes U.S. flight operations and delay data using a hybrid (batch + real-time) architecture.
The platform is designed to support real-time monitoring, daily analytics, and enterprise-grade data modeling using modern tools such as Kafka, Spark, Flink, Airflow, Snowflake, dbt, Power BI, and Grafana.**

- **Objectives**
    - **To build a scalable data platform that can:**
      **Stream real-time flight events (delays, cancellations, diversions)**
      **Perform batch processing on large historical datasets (~7M rows && 35 columns)**
      **Produce clean dimensional models for analytics & machine learning**
      **Deliver live dashboards for decision-making**
